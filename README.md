## Overview

This repository contains a relational database designed to preserve and analyze historical documents and financial records from the early modern period. It aims to facilitate research and provide accessible resources for scholars and enthusiasts in the field of history. The idea starts from my PhD project. 

## Features

- **Structured Data**: The database is organized into multiple tables, each representing different aspects of historical documentation, including:
  - `documents`: Contains various types of documents (e.g., letters, consultas) categorized by genre.
  - `entities`: Stores information about individuals and organizations referenced in the documents.
  - `archive_series`: Represents series of archival documents, providing context and linkage between records.

- **Data Relationships**: Tables are interconnected, allowing for complex queries and analysis of historical trends and relationships.

### Prerequisites

To work with this database, you will need:

- PostgreSQL installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of SQL and relational database concepts.
- Intermediate or, better, advanced historical knowledge.


----NDR
I intend to upload every significant db alteration. This is clearly a work-in-progress type of thing, but I'll try to make something replicable. In any case, if this kind of word tickles your imagination but you think you don't have the right historical knowledge, feel free to contact me!
