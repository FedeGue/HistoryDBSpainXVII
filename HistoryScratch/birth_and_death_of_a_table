-- first it was:
CREATE TABLE spanish_kings (
startReign INT NOT NULL, -- this NOT NULL was a really bad, bad decision : INSERT INTO persons (name, surname, birth, death, noble_title)
 endReign INT NOT NULL
) INHERITS (persons);                                                                          VALUES (
                                                                         'Fernando','de Aragón', 1452, 1516, 'King of Aragón (II), King of Castilla (V)')
                                                                           ERRORE: viola vincolo NOT NULL. --I had to remove the constraint. 




-- like the name sugests, I wanted to create a table in which insert the spanish kings, that (yes) are also people. So, thinking about the OOP I made a Mistake: I created the table like a daughter type of table.
-- but the inheritance didn't worked like I wanted to. It gave me a bad headhache. First: redundance. Obv the daughter takes everything from the parent (at least le logical structure) , but I really just wanted something else
-- in fact I only wanted to refer to the "persons" table with the person_id. 

-- all the above didn't stop me to pursue my desire so I:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION persons_insert_trigger()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$  -- Indica che la funzione restituisce un tipo TRIGGER
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO spanish_kings (person_id, name, surname, birth, death, noble_title)
    VALUES (NEW.person_id, NEW.name, NEW.surname, NEW.birth, NEW.death, NEW.noble_title);  -- Inserisce i dati nella tabella figlia
--  RETURN NULL; I didn't wanted to write only in the daughter but also in the parent.
    RETURN NEW;  -- Restituisce i dati per continuare l'inserimento nella tabella padre 
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER insert_persons_tigger
BEFORE INSERT ON persons
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION persons_insert_trigger();

-- this made me nauseus
-- I decided to delete some columns: error. I can't, it's a child-table!::

alter table spanish_kings 
drop column birth,
drop column death;

-- In this moment (some hours) I decided that the Inheritance thing wasn't my thing: now I wanted to drop the inheritance. 
DROP FUNCTION persons_insert_trigger;
DROP TRIGGER after_insert_persons ON persons;

-- That didn't resolved my problems. I deleted the spanish_kings table and I decided to :

CREATE TABLE kings (person_id INT NOT NULL, 
title_kingdom TEXT NOT NULL, 
kingdom TEXT NOT NULL, 
startreign INT NOT NULL, 
endreign INT NOT NULL);

ALTER TABLE kings 
ADD CONSTRAINT kings_fk
FOREIGN KEY (person_id) REFERENCES persons(person_id);
